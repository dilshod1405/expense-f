## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is the **frontend** part of the Expense Dashboard — a sleek, dark-themed dashboard built using **React.js** and **Chart.js**.  
It fetches monthly expense data from a backend API and displays an interactive line chart with colored data points indicating spending trends:

- 🔴 Red points mark increased expenses  
- 🟢 Green points highlight decreased expenses  
- ⚠️ A warning banner notifies when expenses rise

This UI is designed to help companies easily track and analyze their expense fluctuations over the last year.
